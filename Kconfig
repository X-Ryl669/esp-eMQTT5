    config ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        bool "Enable the eMQTT5 component"
        default y
        help
            This enables the eMQTT5 component.

    config ESP_EMQTT5_STACK_SIZE
        int "MQTT event loop expected task stack size"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default 256
        help
        Temporary buffer allocations are prefered on the stack before being done on the heap. If you run eMQTT5 event loop in a task, please set the maximum size that's safe to allocate on stack here.

    config ESP_EMQTT5_TLS_ENABLE
        bool "Enable TLS connection"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default n
        help
        You can activate TLS but it burns space in memory and flash.

    config ESP_EMQTT5_LOW_LATENCY
        bool "Enable low latency event loop"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default n
        help
        This prevent blocking on the MQTT socket in the eventLoop. This means the default timeout that's set isn't respected, and a 100% CPU hog if you don't throttle the eventLoop in your task yourself.

    config ESP_EMQTT5_AUTH
        bool "Enable AUTH packet processing"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default n
        help
        If you want to support AUTH packet with your broker, enable this.

    config ESP_EMQTT5_UBSUB
        bool "Enable dynamic unsubscribe function"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default n
        help
        Only required if you need to unsubsribe to a topic without disconnecting. Increase binary size if selected

    config ESP_EMQTT5_DUMP
        bool "Enable communication dumping"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default n
        help
        Only for debugging purpose, this will dump all communication between the client and the broker. Don't let this enabled for production as it will show all secrets in the logs

    config ESP_EMQTT5_SKIPVAL
        bool "Skip object validation"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default n
        help
        Only if you master the broker and know it's compliant, you can remove all checks for valid packets. This reduces binary size but it's unsafe

    config ESP_EMQTT5_QOSSUPPORTLEVEL
        int "Quality Of Service support mode"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default 1
        help
        1 for complete QoS management with resend on reconnect, 0 for QoS support but no resend on reconnect (saves 3x the recv buffer size of heap space), and -1 to disable QoS support (smallest binary size)


    config ESP_EMQTT5_FORCEINCLUDE
        string "Path to include file to be used before any other. Default to empty file"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
        default "empty.hpp"
        help
        If you have a mutex class and/or a string class you can force including a file to use them instead of std::string and a dumb spinlock
