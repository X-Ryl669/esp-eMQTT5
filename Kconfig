config ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
    bool "Enable the eMQTT5 component"
    default y
    help
        This enables the eMQTT5 component.

config ESP_EMQTT5_STACK_SIZE
    int "MQTT event loop expected task stack size"
        depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
    default 256
    help
        Temporary buffer allocations are prefered on the stack before being done on the heap. If you run eMQTT5 event loop in a task, please set the maximum size that's safe to allocate on stack here.

config ESP_EMQTT5_TLS_ENABLE
   bool "Enable TLS connection"
   depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
   default n
   help
        You can activate TLS but it burns space in memory and flash.

config ESP_EMQTT5_AUTH
   bool "Enable AUTH packet processing"
   depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
   default n
   help
        If you want to support AUTH packet with your broker, enable this. 

config ESP_EMQTT5_DUMP
   bool "Enable communication dumping"
   depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
   default n
   help
        Only for debugging purpose, this will dump all communication between the client and the broker. Don't let this enabled for production as it will show all secrets in the logs

config ESP_EMQTT5_SKIPVAL
   bool "Skip object validation"
   depends on ESP_EMQTT5_ENABLED
   default n
   help
        Only if you master the broker and know it's compliant, you can remove all checks for valid packets. This reduces binary size but it's unsafe
